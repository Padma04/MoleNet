# TinyML Keyword Spotting on MoleNet ESP32-S3

This experiment implements **on-device keyword spotting (KWS)** on the **MoleNet V7.1 ESP32-S3** using an **INMP441 I2S microphone**.

The system recognizes three spoken keywords:

- `YES`
- `NO`
- `UP`

The complete audio-processing and inference pipeline runs locally on the ESP32-S3.

The detected keyword controls the onboard D6 LED:

| Keyword | Action |
|---|---|
| `YES` | D6 LED ON |
| `NO` | D6 LED OFF |
| `UP` | D6 LED blinks 3 times |

The firmware records two seconds of audio at 16 kHz and automatically selects the strongest one-second speech region for classification.

## Hardware

### Required Hardware

- MoleNet V7.1 with ESP32-S3
- INMP441 I2S microphone
- USB cable

### INMP441 Wiring

| INMP441 | MoleNet V7.1 |
|---|---|
| VDD | 3.3 V |
| GND | GND |
| SCK / BCLK | GPIO40 |
| WS / LRCLK | GPIO41 |
| SD | GPIO42 |
| L/R | GND |

`L/R` is connected to GND, therefore the microphone is read from the left I2S channel.

The onboard action LED used in this experiment is:

```text
D6 -> GPIO38
```

# Build and Run

## 1. Install ESP-IDF

The experiment was tested with:

```text
ESP-IDF v6.0.2
Target: ESP32-S3
```

ESP-IDF installation:

https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v6.0/esp32s3/get-started/index.html

Windows setup:

https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/windows-setup.html

After installation, open an ESP-IDF terminal.

---

## 2. Open the Firmware Directory

From the MoleNet repository root:

```bash
cd experiments/TinyML_Keyword_Spotting/firmware
```

---

## 3. Set the ESP32-S3 Target

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32s3
```

---

## 4. Build the Firmware

```bash
idf.py build
```

ESP-DL is declared in:

```text
main/idf_component.yml
```

and is resolved by the ESP-IDF Component Manager during the build.

---

## 5. Connect the Board

Connect the MoleNet board to the computer using USB.

Identify the serial port.

Examples:

```text
Windows : COM34
Linux   : /dev/ttyUSB0
macOS   : /dev/cu.usbmodem...
```

---

## 6. Flash and Open the Serial Monitor

```bash
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

Example:

```bash
idf.py -p COM34 flash monitor
```

Replace `PORT` with the port assigned to the board.

Exit the serial monitor with:

```text
Ctrl + ]
```

---

## 7. Test Keyword Recognition

Follow the prompt in the serial monitor and speak one of:

```text
YES
NO
UP
```

Expected LED behavior:

```text
YES -> D6 ON
NO  -> D6 OFF
UP  -> D6 blinks 3 times
```

An LED action is performed when prediction confidence is at least:

```text
70%
```

---

# How the Firmware Works

## 1. Audio Capture

The INMP441 microphone is sampled using the ESP32-S3 I2S interface.

```text
Sample rate : 16 kHz
Capture time: 2 seconds
Samples     : 32000
```

---

## 2. Speech-Region Selection

The model expects one second of audio.

The firmware searches the two-second recording for the strongest speech region and selects a one-second segment:

```text
16000 samples
```

This allows the keyword to be spoken anywhere within the capture period.

---

## 3. Audio Quality Check

Before feature extraction, the selected audio is checked for:

- low signal level
- clipping
- excessive microphone input level

The firmware uses an RMS threshold to reject very quiet recordings and checks the fraction of samples close to full-scale amplitude.

---

## 4. MFCC Feature Extraction

The selected one-second audio segment is converted to MFCC features directly on the ESP32-S3.

Configuration:

```text
Sample rate : 16000 Hz
FFT size    : 1024
Window      : 800 samples
Window time : 50 ms
Hop         : 160 samples
Hop time    : 10 ms
Mel filters : 128
MFCCs       : 40
Frames      : 101
```

Final model input:

```text
40 x 101 MFCC
```

Processing:

```text
Audio
  |
  v
Hann window
  |
  v
1024-point FFT
  |
  v
Power spectrum
  |
  v
Mel filterbank
  |
  v
dB conversion
  |
  v
DCT
  |
  v
40 x 101 MFCC
```

The following preprocessing parameters are embedded into the firmware:

```text
hann_window.bin
mel_filterbank_transposed.bin
dct_matrix.bin
```

KISS FFT is used for the FFT computation.

---

## 5. Neural-Network Inference

The MFCC features are passed to the embedded ESP-DL model:

```text
main/models/kws_3class.espdl
```

Output classes:

```text
0 -> YES
1 -> NO
2 -> UP
```

The predicted class and confidence are printed in the serial monitor.

Predictions below the configured confidence threshold do not trigger the LED action.

# Troubleshooting

## No Microphone Signal

Check the wiring:

```text
VDD -> 3.3 V
GND -> GND
SCK -> GPIO40
WS  -> GPIO41
SD  -> GPIO42
L/R -> GND
```

---

## Input Level Too High

Speak at a normal volume or increase the distance between the speaker and microphone.

Strongly clipped audio can reduce recognition accuracy.

---

## ESP-DL Build Error

Run:

```bash
idf.py fullclean
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build
```

---

## Wrong Serial Port

Check the board's serial port and use:

```bash
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

---

## Repeated Incorrect Prediction

Check:

- microphone wiring
- background noise
- microphone distance
- speech volume
- clipping
- correct `.espdl` model
- MFCC parameter files
